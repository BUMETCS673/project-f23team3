# Abstract

The proposed system is an “Online Restaurant Ordering System”  designed to facilitate the ordering process for both customers and the restaurant staff. It is developed using Python Flask. It involves the utilization of QR codes assigned to each table, enabling users to access the restaurant’s menu and place orders. The system is envisioned to optimize the ordering process, reducing wait times and human errors, while offering real-time updates to the kitchen staff. Here’s a breakdown of the system functionality:

User Interaction Systems:

Users scan the QR code at their table, which directs them to the restaurant’s webpage.
They view the menu and add desired items to their shopping basket.
Users can place the order, and if needed, place additional orders before final checkout.
Order Processing:

The backend receives the order with the associated table number.
The kitchen staff is promptly notified of the incoming orders to prepare the dishes.
Checkout and Payment:

Once the guests decide they do not want to order any more dishes, they can finalize their order and proceed to check out directly through the page, facilitating a seamless payment process.

E-menu & Ordering Systems:

Various studies and projects have been developed to explore e-menu systems, focusing on graphical representation, user interaction, and efficient order placement. They integrate visual elements, clear categorization, and real-time updates to provide a comprehensive ordering experience.

Table Management Systems:

These systems are designed to optimize table assignments and manage reservations effectively. Integrating them with ordering systems enables the restaurants to associate orders with specific tables seamlessly.


User Experience (UX) & User Interface (UI) Design:

Prior research and developments in UX and UI design principles aim at providing intuitive and user-friendly interfaces for online ordering systems, ensuring the overall satisfaction of the users.

Real-Time Notification Systems:

To ensure the efficient processing of orders, real-time notification systems have been incorporated into restaurant ordering systems to notify kitchen staff immediately when an order is placed.

QR Code Integration:

The implementation of QR codes in restaurant ordering systems is not novel, and various applications using QR codes for menu access and order placement have been developed.

Conclusion:

The proposed Online Restaurant Ordering System utilizing Python Flask and QR codes aims to enhance the dining experience for customers while streamlining the order management process for the restaurant staff. By integrating proven methods from related works, including real-time notifications, seamless payment options, intuitive user interface design, and efficient order processing mechanisms, the system is poised to offer a comprehensive solution to modern restaurant management challenges.
